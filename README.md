Sniper Bot Project

Project Overview

The Sniper Bot is an automated trading bot designed for rapid token sniping on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and PancakeSwap. It facilitates the buying of newly listed tokens quickly to take advantage of price surges, making it an invaluable tool for traders looking to capitalize on early opportunities in the cryptocurrency market.

Features

Token Sniping: Automatically buy newly listed tokens within milliseconds of their launch.
Multi-Exchange Support: Operates on both Uniswap (Ethereum) and PancakeSwap (Binance Smart Chain).
Monitoring: Continuously monitors for new token listings and price movements.
Wallet Management: Securely manages wallet operations and transactions.
Transaction Handling: Efficiently handles buying and selling operations with comprehensive logging for analysis.

Script Descriptions

1. .env
This file contains environment variables, including sensitive data such as wallet private keys and API keys. Make sure to keep this file secure and never expose it publicly.

3. sniper_bot.py
This is the main entry point for running the sniper bot. It initializes the bot, loads configurations, and starts the monitoring and sniping processes.

5. config.py
This configuration file manages settings such as token addresses, slippage percentages, and API endpoints. It allows for easy adjustments to the bot's behavior without modifying the codebase.

7. sniper.py
This script contains the core logic for the sniping process. It monitors token listings and executes buy orders based on predefined criteria, ensuring that the bot can react quickly to market changes.

9. requirements.txt
A list of required Python packages and their versions necessary for running the sniper bot. Use this file to install dependencies with pip.

11. logs/
This directory stores log files that capture bot activities, including transactions, errors, and operational messages, which are useful for debugging and analysis.

- sniper_bot.log
A log file specifically dedicated to storing activities of the sniper bot, allowing users to track its performance and any issues that arise.

7. abis/
A directory to store ABI (Application Binary Interface) JSON files, which define how to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain networks.

- pancakeswap_router_abi.json
Contains the ABI for PancakeSwap’s router contract, essential for executing trades on the PancakeSwap exchange.

- uniswap-v2-factory.abi.json
Contains the ABI for Uniswap V2’s factory contract, crucial for interacting with Uniswap for token listings and transactions.

8. utils/
A collection of utility scripts that provide various helper functions used throughout the bot.

- __init__.py
This file makes the utils directory a Python package, allowing for structured imports.

- blockchain.py
Contains utility functions for blockchain interactions, including connecting to nodes and fetching data.

- monitor.py
Functions for monitoring new token listings on exchanges, alerting the bot when potential sniping opportunities arise.

- snipe.py
Implements the token sniping functionality, including criteria for when to buy a token and how to execute the buy order.

- security.py
Provides security measures, including functions for securely handling sensitive data such as private keys and API tokens.

- wallet.py
Functions for managing wallet interactions, including connecting to wallets and retrieving balances.

- logger.py
A centralized logging configuration that standardizes logging practices across the bot, improving debugging and analysis capabilities.

9. modules/
Contains scripts focused on core functionalities and analyses related to the sniper bot.

- analyzer.py
Implements functions to analyze potential tokens based on price history, trading volume, and other metrics to identify good sniping opportunities.

- check_balance.py
Contains functions to check and report the balance of specific tokens held in the wallet.

- transaction.py
Manages buying and selling transactions, interacting with smart contracts to execute trades.

10. markdown/
This directory contains documentation for the project, including guides and the README file.

- README.md
The main documentation file providing an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
